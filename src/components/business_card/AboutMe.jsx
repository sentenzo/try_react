    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Mr. KÃ¤tt and I am a professional cat.
        Or I used to identify myself as one of as far as I can remember.

    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
        In the nearest future I'm willing to stay a professional cat  and to perform my duties with diligence.
        Those duties mentioned are related (but not limited) to:
        pests control,
        protecting the territory from the unbidden outsiders (mostly, the other professional cats),
        eating, sleeping, purring.
    </p>
